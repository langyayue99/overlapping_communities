Network 15: The US power grid
This is the network is the high-voltage power grid in the Western States of the United States of America. The nodes are transformers, substations, and generators, and the ties are high-voltage transmission lines. This network was originally used in Watts and Strogatz (1998). Although the transmission lines can be directed and differentiated based on their capacity, this information is not available.
